# Step 1: Use tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask as the base image
FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.9

# Set environment variables for Flask
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Copy your Flask app into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any additional dependencies (if needed)
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir <your-dependencies>

# Expose the ports for Flask and Nginx
EXPOSE 5000 80

# Optionally configure Nginx (it comes with default config already)
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Optionally install any additional libraries or dependencies
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <packages>

# This image already has Nginx and uWSGI configured, so no need to run any extra services
